# Flowmon & QRadar Integration

Flowmon QRadar integration provides a single pane of glass to detect and respond to Flowmon ADS events directly in IBM QRadar.

Flowmon QRadar integration is available in two packages. The first package (**Flowmon QRadar App**) is an application that integrates 
the event analysis workflows more seamlessly from Flowmon ADS into your QRadar, resulting in a more consistent experience. 
The second package (**Flowmon ADS Content Pack**) is a connector and a content package that efficiently configures correlation rules based on ADS events, 
generating higher-level incidents for a thorough understanding of security issues.
